Many different systems for classifying speakers' communicative intents have been developed and used in research analyzing both the acquisition of speech acts and the nature of the communicative deficits shown by various language-impaired populations. We argue, though, that these systems have typically been limited in scope, in applicability across the full developmental range, or in their theoretical foundations. The criteria for an adequate system for analyzing communicative intents are discussed, and a system proposed which meets those criteria.},

@article{dore_1975,
	abstract = {The arguments both for and against viewing the child's initial one-word utterances as HOLOPHRASES are reviewed. Some theoretical problems -- concerning the innateness of language, the acquisition of syntax, the status of prosody and the child's comprehension of language during the one-word stage -- with the holophrase controversy are pointed out. We suggest that an unresolvable theoretical stalemate exists because proponents on both sides of the controversy mistakenly assume the centrality of the notion sentence in discussing holophrases. An alternative view of early language development, which takes the SPEECH ACT as the basic unit of linguistic communication, is offered as a solution to the problems with the holophrase controversy as it now stands. We propose a more integrated description of the relations between functional and grammatical aspects of early communicative competence than is currently provided by sentence-oriented theories. In particular, we suggest that the child's PRAGMATIC INTENTIONS gradually become GRAMMATICALIZED as semantic and syntactic structures. Finally, three entities -- communicative functions, referring expressions and predicating expressions -- are proposed as LANGUAGE UNIVERSALS, as distinct from grammatical universals.},

@misc{dore_communicative_1974,
	abstract = {This paper proposes a theory on how language functions for the child and in what sequence these functions develop. The notion of communicative intention is contrasted with grammatical categories and with the goal of an utterance. Finally, communicative intentions and goals of utterances are contrasted with the innumerable pragmatic puEposes which accompany speech. Together these functions, along with the grammatical components of the sentence, constitute the total speech act which is taken to be the fundamental unit of linguistic communication. The data reported suggest that various intentions gradually become ugrammaticalized\&quot; or \&quot;lexicalizedu in the course of language development. It is concluded that communicative intentions and other functional aspects of language play a greater role in the organization and choice of utterances than has been supposed by grammatical theories of language development.

Before moving to UMass in 1998, she had a joint appointment in English and psychology, and was coordinator of the Bilingualism Study Group at the University of Miami. Her research has focused on language acquisition in children of Hispanic-American background and those speaking African-American English. Her publications are primarily in lexical, phonological, and narrative development in typically developing and language impaired children. She has participated in two large-scale studies involving about 1000 children each, published in Language and Literacy in Bilingual Children (Multilingual Matters), and Evaluating language variation: distinguishing dialect and development from disorder (Thieme Medical Publishers).},

@book{macwhinney_childes_2000,
	abstract = {Volume I is the first of two volumes that document the three components of the CHILDES Project. It is divided into two parts which provide an introduction to the use of computational tools for studying language learning. The first part is the CHAT manual, which describes the conventions and principles of CHAT transcription and recommends specific methods for data collection and digitization. The second part is the CLAN manual, which describes the uses of the editor, sonic CHAT, and the various analytic commands. The book will be useful for both novice and experienced users of the CHILDES tools, as well as instructors and students working with transcripts of child language.   Volume II describes in detail all of the corpora included in the CHILDES database. The conversational interactions in the corpora come from monolingual children and their caregivers and siblings, as well as bilingual children, older school-aged children, adult second-language learners, children with various types of language disabilities, and aphasic recovering from language loss. The database includes transcripts in 26 different languages.   The CD-ROM that accompanies these volumes includes the transcript files described in Volume II. It runs on both Windows and Macintosh platforms. For more information or updates to the files, visit the CHILDES website at http://childes.psy.cmu.edu},

@article{snow_learning_1996,
	abstract = {In this paper we present a set of methods for describing development in the expression of communicative intents. Studying children in interaction with a parent, we found children improved from age 14 to 32 months in the number of communicative attempts per minute they made, in the intelligibility of their attempts, as well as in the repertoire of intents they expressed. Correlations with other language measures suggest that a complete picture of language development requires a description of pragmatic skills in addition to syntactic and lexical indices. Our two-level coding scheme revealed that the social-interactive interchanges most commonly engaged in by the youngest children were negotiating immediate activity, discussing a joint focus of attention, and directing hearer's attention. Within these social interchanges, a small but widely shared set of communicative intents was expressed by the younger children; surprisingly, questions were quite late emerging communicative intents, as were agreeing, disagreeing, and giving reasons},

	abstract = {Children, like adults, use language to get things done. However, gaining an accurate picture of children's development of communicative intent is challenging. While the behaviours used by children to express intent are external and thus to some degree measurable, the underlying psychological characterisation of intent is much more elusive. Speech act analysis involves identifying the goal behind a speaker's utterance, gesture or sign, and provides a useful starting point for the analysis of communicative intent during both the pre-linguistic and linguistic stage. In the current chapter we begin by discussing the origins of Speech Act Theory and its relevance to child language development. We then discuss the emergence of speech acts in the language of young children, and also the relationship between form and function from a Speech Act perspective.},

Principally, the contributions to this volume deal with pragmatic competence in a native language, in a second or foreign language, and in a selection of language disorders. The topics which are covered explore questions of production and comprehension on the utterance and discourse level. Topics addressed concern the acquisition and learning, teaching and testing, assessment and treatment of various aspects of pragmatic ability, knowledge and use. These include, for example, the acquisition and development of speech acts, implicatures, irony, story-telling and interactional competence. Phenomena such as pragmatic awareness and pragmatic transfer are also addressed. The disorders considered include clinical conditions pertaining to children and to adults. Specifically, these are, among others, autism spectrum disorders, Down syndrome, and Alzheimer's disease.},
